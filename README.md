## Overview

**Sistem Informasi Pemancingan Sutoyo** is a full-stack web-based management information system designed for a fishing pond business. It digitises and automates the core operational workflows — from customer check-in and order management to checkout, digital receipts, and financial reporting.

This system was developed as an undergraduate thesis (skripsi) to address the operational inefficiencies commonly found in small- to medium-scale fishing pond businesses that still rely on manual, paper-based processes.

The key pain points the system resolves:

## System Flow

```
Customer Arrives
     │
     ▼
QR Scan / Name Search → Check-In Created (Member or Guest)
     │
     ▼
Employee Adds Pending Orders (food, rentals)
     │
     ▼
Production Status Updated: Pending → Processing → Done
(orders can be cancelled individually before checkout)
     │
     ▼
Checkout → Payment Recorded
(payment proof required for Transfer / QRIS)
     │
     ▼
Deposit settled or refunded
     │
     ▼
Points & Voucher Updated (members only)
     │
     ▼
Receipt (Nota) Generated → Print / Send via WhatsApp

> **Background Schedulers:** the system runs scheduled tasks for monthly voucher disbursement and automatic points expiry — points are reset after 180 days of customer inactivity, with an in-app warning sent 7 days in advance.

## Environment Variables

### Frontend (`.env`)

| Variable            | Description                 | Example                     |

## API

The backend exposes a RESTful JSON API documented using `.http` files (compatible with the [VS Code REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension). These files are located in the `backend` branch.

**API Groups:**

| Group        | Description                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Public**   | Landing page data (leaderboard, events, fish types, special menus) |
| **Auth**     | Login, logout, register                                            |
| **Member**   | Profile, points, vouchers, transaction history                     |
| **Employee** | Check-in, arrivals, pending orders, checkout, receipts             |
| **Owner**    | Members, reports, inventory, events, fish stocks, menu management  |
